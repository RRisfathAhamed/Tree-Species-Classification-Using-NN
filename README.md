# Tree Species Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains code for developing a neural network model to classify tree species based on leaf features. The project focuses on classifying three challenging-to-distinguish tree species found in the university garden: *Caesalpinia pulcherrima*, *Acacia caesia*, and *Peltophorum pterocarpum*.

## Files

- `Euphoria.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Euphoria.csv`: Dataset containing leaf feature measurements collected from mature specimens of the selected tree species in the university garden.

2. Open `Euphoria.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment or Google CoLab.

3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Results

The trained model achieves a test accuracy of 93.33% on the testing dataset. Further analysis of the model's performance, including qualitative assessment and discussion on results, can be found in the project report.
